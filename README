Madison Academic Magnet High School
Joy McKissack-I mainly worked of the side navbar, the home page, and the contact us page.
  Working on the side nav was my biggest obsticle in this project
 I managed to create exactly what i wanted but I did run into several issues throughout the process.
 My biggest accomplishment was linking an icon in the side navbar to a specific part of another page.
 
Jeremiah Day- I mostly worked on the Menu Pages and the Navbar at the begining of the Project.


Mekhi Morris-I worked on the desserts, Kids Menu, and About us page. I had issues creatiing the navbar to the right size and making it function properly, but I was able to fix it quickly. We put pictuees and carousels for each of the pages. I belive coding is a very intresting and fun
